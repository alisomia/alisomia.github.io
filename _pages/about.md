I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Peking University, working in applied and computational mathematics. Currently, I am supervised by Prof. Jun Hu. I obtained by bachelor degree from Peking University in 2021. I work on

- Finite element construction, some metatheory of finite elements and splines.
- Finite element exterior calculus and finite element tensor complex.
- Approximation theory in control theory and deep learning.
- Numerical analysis for elasticity problem and microlocal structures.
